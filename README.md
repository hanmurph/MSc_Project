Code used for my MSc project - Analyzing mouse RNA sequencing data


fastq_lane_merging.sh -----> this is a bash script I used to merge fastq files from different lanes in a sequencing experiment. 
                             Each of my samples was run on two lanes (replicates) so I needed to merge the lanes so there is one file per sample.
